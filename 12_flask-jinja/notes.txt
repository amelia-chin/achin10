K12 - ...or The Only Constant is Change? (experimenting with Flask and introducing Jinja2 to serve templated pages)
2020-10-13

Observations about app.py:

Q0: What happens if you remove render_template from this line?
- we won't be able to use the "render_template" function, because the file will not be able to access the Jinja2 formatting template
- edit: we tried removing "render_template" and got a NameError

Q1: Can all of your teammates confidently predict the URL to use to load this page?
- we think the URL will be "http://localhost:5000/my_foist_template"
- however, we are only 1/3 fully confident (liam is very confident, amelia and maddy are moderately confident)

Q2: What is the significance of each argument?
- first argument: name of file with Jinja2 template and html formatting, in this case "model_tmplt.html"
- second arugment: website's title or what's written on the tab, in this case "fooooo", will be used in the template where it says "{{ foo }}" 
- third arugment: "coll" will be used in the template where it says "collection", this is the list that will be iterated through 


Observations about model_tmplt.html:
- we notice this file is made up of a combination of Jinja2 and html syntax
- contents of the body are the Jinja2 syntax for a for loop
- we think that double curly braces indicate a variable
- we think that one curly brace and a percent sign indicate a function


Expected Outcome:
- if the URL you enter is "http://localhost:5000":
	- a local web page with "No hablo queso!" displayed on it
- if the URL you enter is "http://localhost:5000/my_foist_template":
	- webpage title will be "fooooo"
	- will display all the elements in "coll" on different lines (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8) <-- fibonacci sequence


Tested Output:
- for both cases, the tested output matched our expectations


General Questions: 
- why do we use "foo"? why not anything else?
	edit: we looked it up and it comes from the term "foobar"
	edit2: why "foobar"? where did this term come from?
