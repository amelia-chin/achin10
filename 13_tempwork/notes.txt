K13 -- Template for Success
Summary: Wrote a flask app to generate a table showing the occupations data and a randomly selected occupation. We read egoless programming.
2020-10-15

We used a mixture of k10 and 02_flask-jinja to write app.py.
Making a table with 3 rows is harder than making a table with two rows.
Also, making a dictionary with multiple values is complicated. The types get confusing.

From the text, we learned to be respectful when discussing other people's code and to also be open minded when hearing constructive criticism.

It took longer than expected to find acceptable links for jobs.
