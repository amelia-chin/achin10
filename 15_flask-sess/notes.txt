K15 â€” Sessions Greetings / write a Flask app that uses session capabilities to allow a user to login and logout
2020-12-12

- We used the POST method to get the username and password from the form to our flask app
- then, we checked the inputted username and password with our hardcoded ones
- if they matched, we added the data to the session and routed the user to welcome.html
- if they didn't, we displayed an appropriate error message using one template, error.html
- we also added a route for logging out, which removes the inputted data from the session and redirects you to the login page
- we used buttons to redirect to login page

something we want to know how to do in the future:
- how to reroute to an existing page rather than just redirecting
	- ex: when logging out, we wanted to reroute to the root route, but instead had to render login.html
- how to use cookies? what's the difference between request.cookies.get(key) and request.form[key]? 
	- we tried to use cookies at first, but it gave us an error
