K08 -- Cross Pollination and Virtual Insanity, Task Alpha: Q/C/C from K07
2020-10-04

Questions:
- for random.choices: weights vs cum_weights?
- why is closing the file necessary? is it really necessary?
- general confusion about "if __name__ == "__main__":"
- what does "with open(csv, 'r') as in_stream:" do?

Comments:
- used random.choices with percentages being the weights
- lots of teams casts the dictionary into a list
- big block comment at the top and general commenting throughout helps us understand code better
- some people used "import random" and others used "from random import choices"
- removed "Job Class" and "Total" keys with .pop
- can initialize a variable to a for loop and you can embed some for loops into brackets and it turns into a list (ex: weights = [float(x) for x in list(Dict.values())])
- some people closed the file
- didn't know you could do "del jobs[0]"
- noticed a variety of ways to generate a random number 
- imported csv, used DictReader to make a dictionary
- used random.uniform to get a random decimal 
- some people made a main function and called it at the end

Concerns:
- some print statements were really long, could be better to make into a variable then print
- ways to make block comments instead of putting a # before each line
- some people had their total percentage out of 100 instead of 99.8
- main function doesn't seem to be necessary
