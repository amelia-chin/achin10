K08 -- Cross Pollination and Virtual Insanity, Task Beta: investigating $ python3 -m venv ~/myherozero
2020-10-04

python3 : opens a python shell
-m : lets you run modules 
venv : module that creates a virtual environment 
~/myherozero : location of new virtual environment that is being created

A virtual environment allows the user to use python with different packages. In a virtual environment, everything that you
download and create is isolated from and does not alter your system's python. This is helpful when one project requires a 
different set of packages than the ones you have in your system's or a different virtual environment's python. You can download 
packages directly to the virtual environment where you need them, instead of downloading them globally to your system's python.

"$ python3 -m venv ~/myherozero" creates a new directory called "myherozero" and stores a virtual environment inside of it. Within
"myherozero" there are three directories called "bin," "include," and "lib" as well as "pyvenv.cfg." "bin" contains executable 
commands and "lib" is the version of python that you are running. We're not sure what "include" is, but we think that it's all of 
the external things that you import into this virtual environment ("include" is currently empty). "pyvenv.cfg" configures/sets up 
the virtual environment.
