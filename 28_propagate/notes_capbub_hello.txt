1.) Whenever you click on one of the table entries, it sends you to a pop up where the
    boxes text is the thing that is listed.

2.) Whenever you click on a table entry, it sends you a pop up for the table entry, table
    row and the table itself, with the contents of each being listed. The order seems to be
    entry > row > table, even if you change the order of how these are ran in the code.
    You can also click solely on the table. We don't think you can click solely on the row.

3.) When you put true at the end of the arguments, it seems to "read" them bottom to top,
    prioritizing "true" objects over untrue objects. It seems that putting "false" doesn't do
    anything to the objects either. When you click on the table entry, you get the table first,
    then the content, then the row. But if we had the row also set to true, we would get,
    the row second, then the actual content.
    stopPropagation seems to stop any future runs of that function in the same frame.

4.) We don't know why "true" objects are prioritized over untrue objects. But having them all
    as true makes it so that it runs "most outside" to "most inside".
    stopPropagation seems to do the same thing as before, only allowing one pop up to be made.

    After reading about bubbling, stopProbagation stops anything but the first handler to be run.
    We understood that it was most inside to outside, but we don't know what true actually does.
