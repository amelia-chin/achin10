Chapter 2: Importing, Exporting, and Querying Data

- JSON: JavaScript Standard Object Notation
- JSON format 
	- document starts and ends with curly braces {}
	- each key and value are separated with a colon :
	- each key:value pair is separated by a comma , 
	- "keys" have to be surrounded by quotation marks " " (in MongoDB, "keys" are called "fields")

- JSON pros: user-friendly, readable, and familiar
- JSON cons: text-based format that makes parsing very slow, space-consuming, only supports a limited number of data types

- BSON: Binary JSON, a binary representation to store data in JSON format
- built for speed, space, flexibility, high-performance, and general focus

- JSON:
	- encoding: UTF-8 String
	- data supported: String, Boolean, Number, Array
	- readability: human and machine 
- BSON:
	- encoding: binary
	- data supported: String, Boolean, Number (Integer, Long, Float, etc), Date, Raw Binary
	- readability: machine only
	- additional data types allow for better communication b/w databases and applications written in a variety of languages

- MongoDB stores data in BSON internally and over the network 
- anything represented in JSON can be stored in and retrieved from MongoDB
- BSON provides additional features (speed, flexibility, etc)

- backup to cloud locally or export to different system --> use BSON
- export to local machine --> use JSON

- export data in BSON:
	- mongodump --uri "<Atlas Cluster URI>"
- export data in JSON:
	- mongoexport --uri "<Atlas Cluster URI>"
	              --collection=<collection name>
	              --out=<filename>.json

- URI: Uniform Resource Identifier 
- MongoDB uses a srv string to establish a secure connection between an application and a MongoDB instance 
- URI connection string format: mongodb+srv://user:password@clusterURI.mongodb.net/database

- import data in BSON dump:
	- mongorestore --uri "<Atlas cluster URI>"
				   -- drop dump
- import data in JSON:
	- mongoimport --uri "<Atlas Cluster URI>"
				  --drop=<filename>.json

- namespace: the concatenation of the database name and collection name
- queries have to use valid JSON 
- returned documents will have the requested field:value pairs in them

- shell commands:
	- show dbs 
	- use <database name>
	- show collections
	- db.<collection name>.find(<query>)
	- it (stands for iterate) used to iterate through a cursor 
		- cursor: a pointer to a result set of a query
		- pointer: direct address to a memory location
	- db.<collection name>.find(<query>).count() returns the number of documents that match the given query
	- db.<collection name>.find(<query>).pretty() returns the documents that match the given query formatted for ease of reading
	- db.<collection name>.find() returns the first 20 documents of the collection
