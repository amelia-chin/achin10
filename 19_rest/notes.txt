K19 -- A RESTful Journey Skyward // exploration into REST APIs
2021-04-05

We started by getting the JSON data to print to a blank webpage
To do this we opened the url using the urllib library and then read it with the read() comand 
Then we used the json library's loads() function to open the data in an easily accessible JSON format
From there all we had to do was access the correct keys and then pass those as variables to our template
