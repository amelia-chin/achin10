K09 -- Simple Path to Greatness (exploring and running our first flask app)
2020-10-07

Q0: we've seen this syntax in Java when initializing an object. It's taking app.py as a parameter 
and creating a Flask object called app. 

Q1: All directories end in '/'

Q2: We think it will print out to the terminal.

Q3: It will print the name of the file, "app"
	update: "__main__" is printed after we open the http link in our browser

Q3.5: No, because when things are returned, they aren't printed.
	  update: once we opened the http link given by the terminal in our web browser, it displayed "No hablo
	  queso!" on a white screen.

Q4: It's like calling an object.function() in Java. 

Notable questions:
- why "lazy loading"? what does that mean?
- why is ""GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -" printed? what does that mean?
