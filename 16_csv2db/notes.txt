K16 â€” No Trouble / write a simple Python script to import CSV data into a relational database
2020-12-14

-DictReader is a method from csv that creates an iterable dictionary that
 creates keys out of the first line of the csv file automatically. When you
 iterate through the DictReader object, each line is stored in the variable
 used to iterate through the for loop as a dictionary. The entries in the line
 can be accessed by calling the variable with the corresponding key. The values
 in this variable dictionary are not remembered once the loop goes to the next
 line, so the values must be stored in another dictionary.

-Is there an easier/more concise way to parse multiple csv files without
 copy pasting all the DictReader code?

-Need to delete the db file contents created in between test runs
    -We used os.remove("./<db name>") to import something
     for a single line to automatically delete the db file.

-command += "<command>" is a readable way to chain multiple commands together

-.format() to pass variables into the string command

-.execute() can only take in one command at a time

-We want to use .executescript() to take in multiple commands because
 pasting .execute a lot of times is annoying and less readable.

-When you open the sqlite db file, it is unreadable because it's in binary.
 for row in c.execute('SELECT * FROM courses;'):
    print(row)
 -This is how we viewed the contents of our table to see if our code worked

-For TEXT types and .format, you need to put "" around the {} or else you get 
 an error
